    <h1>Ricotta Gnocchi</h1>
    <img src="../images/ricotta-gnocchi.jpg" alt="Ricotta Gnocchi">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lighter than their potato based cousins, the ricotta gnocci are great for simple preparations like browned butter
        and sage.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ricotta Cheese</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Finely grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>All purpose flour</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Freshly cracked black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine ricotta and parmesan cheese in a large mixing bowl</li>
        <li>Add the eggs and mix well</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Add a few tablespoons of flour to bring the dough together. Be careful not to add too much flour or to
            overwork the dough.</li>
        <li>Allow the dough to chill for at least an hour</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured work surface, spoon out a quarter of the dough.</li>
        <li>Gently dust with more all purpose flour. </li>
        <li>Roll the dough into a 1/2" log</li>
        <li>Use a floured knife or bench knife to cut the dough into 1/2" pieces and move to a floured baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>Repeat with the other 3/4 of the dough</li>
        <li>chill the formed gnocchi for at least an hour (up to one day) before cooking</li>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to a low boil and add salt</li>
        <li>Add the gnocchi to the water and let boil gently for about 5 mintues. When the gnocchi rise to the top and
            have a sheen, they're ready to come out of the water.</li>
    </ol>
