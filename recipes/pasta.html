    <h1>Fresh Pasta Dough</h1>
    <img src="../images/fresheggpasta.jpg" alt="fresh pasta cut into fettuccine">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sometimes, boxed pasta just won't do. Fresh pasta is great for Bolognese, Alfredo, or with butter and cheese.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Finely milled all purpose flour (tippo 00)</li>
        <li>Semolina flour</li>
        <li>Egg yolks</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all purpose flour and semolina flour </li>
        <li>On a clean work surface, create a mound of the flour and create a well in the center.</li>
        <li>Add the egg yolks to the well and break them apart with a fork</li>
        <li>Beginning slowly, use a fork to slowly incorporate the flour</li>
        <li>Once the egg yolks have taken on enough flour to not be too runny, move to using your hands to bring the
            dough together</li>
        <li>You want the dough to feel slightly dry. It will hydrate while it rests. If it's too dry add a tablespoon of
            water or olive oil</li>
        <li>Knead for 5-7 mintues, until pinching the dough feels like pinching your earlobe. </li>
        <li>Cover in plastic wrap and allow to rest for at least 30 minutes, up to a day in the fridge or a month in the
            freezer.</li>
    </ol>
